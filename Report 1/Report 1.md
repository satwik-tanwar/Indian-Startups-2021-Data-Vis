During January 2021 the condition of daily COVID-19 cases was just getting better and the number of companies registered in most of the days of January was between 550 to 650 approximately but there were some days when it was much lower. 

As the condition was getting better during February the number of companies registered each day increased and the consistency was good, the value even got better in March but in April the second wave of COVID-19 hit us and the number of companies registered each day decreased and the consistency also went down.

It shows the percentage of companies with different activity description that were registered. 

We can clearly observe the sector in which maximum number of companies were registered from the above graphs (Barplot and Pie Chart) 

![](Aspose.Words.02e4c1d8-8466-462b-941e-1b3ff427014e.006.jpeg)

We can observe from the above graph that apart from two sectors (Electricity, Gas & Water Companies and Mining & Quarrying), the difference between authorized and paid-up capital is no that much which means that they have already generated most of the capital that they can but there is a lot of capital available that can be generated in Electricity, Gas & Water Companies and Mining & Quarrying. 

If we look at the above three plots we can observe that only 1% and 0.6% of total companies  registered  were  in  Electricity,  Gas  &  Water  Companies  and  Mining  & Quarrying sectors respectively but the amount of capital left to be generated in these sectors  is  enormous,  therefore  these  sectors  have  a  lot  of  potential  for  future opportunities provided people can come up with new innovative ideas to make proper use of this potential.

This graph shows the trends of authorized and paid-up capitals of companies in the top 5 states. We can observe that there is a very less difference between authorized and paid-up capitals in almost every sector as compared to the data of all the states and also the difference for Electricity, Gas & Water Companies is significantly lower. This is due to the fact that most of the big companies are located in these places and also there is a lot of competition in these places.  

Mining and Quarrying still have a lot of potential capital to be generated in these states as compared to other sectors.
