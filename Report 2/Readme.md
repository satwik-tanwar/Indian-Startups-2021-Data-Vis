**Screenshots and Explanation(Dashboard and Interactive Plots): *Dashboard:*** 

The dashboard contains three tabs named Bar Charts, Geographical Plot and Other Charts. Every chart in the Bar Chart section has a slider below it to select the number of bars that the user wants to display. There is also a radio button to switch between visualizing data for all the companies or only for subsidiaries of foreign companies that were registered between January 2021 and April 2021,  this  feature  is  added  to  have  a  better  understanding  about  foreign investment trends in India.

*Fig 6: Monthly trends for registered companies (Foreign Companies only)* 

This *Bar Graph* shows the total number of companies that were registered in each month in the given period of time. During January 2021 the condition of daily COVID-19 cases was just getting better and the number of companies registered in most of the days of January was between 300 to 600 approximately (from *Box Plot).* 

As the condition was getting better during February the number of companies registered each day increased and the value even got better in March but in April  the  second  wave  of  COVID-19  hit  us  and  the  number  of  companies registered each day decreased significantly. 

The same trends have been reflected for **Foreign Investments** in India too.

*Fig 12:Foreign Companies Registered in each Registrar of Companies (RoC).* 

This *bar chart* compares the number of companies registered in each RoC. We can observe that the top five RoC are from the top 5 states for all companies including foreign companies too and therefore, we can conclude that the trends that we observed for these stats are reflected on these RoC.

*Fig 13: Geographical Plot of companies registered in each state and union territory.*

*Fig 15: Pie Chart for comparison of registered companies in each sector* 

It shows the percentage of companies with different activity description i.e. sector that were registered. 

We can clearly observe that maximum number of companies were registered in Business Services Sector from the above graphs (Bar Chart and Pie Chart).

*Fig 16: Comparison of Authorized and Paid-up capital for all companies.* 

We can observe from the above graph that apart from two sectors (Electricity, Gas & Water Companies and Mining & Quarrying), the difference between authorized and paid-up capital is not that much which means that they have already generated most of the capital that they can but there is a lot of capital available that can be generated in Electricity, Gas & Water Companies and Mining & Quarrying. 

If we look at the above three plots we can observe that only 1% and 0.6% of total companies registered were in Electricity, Gas & Water Companies and Mining & Quarrying sectors respectively but the amount of capital left to be generated in these sectors is enormous, therefore these sectors have a lot of potential for future opportunities provided people can come up with new innovative ideas to make proper use of this potential.

*Fig 18: Comparison of Authorized and Paid-up capital for Foreign companies.* 

This shows the difference between authorized and paid-up capitals of foreign companies. We can observe that for most of the sectors, authorized and paid- up capitals are same but in Business services there is a good difference between them indicating potential of growth in this sector for foreign companies.
